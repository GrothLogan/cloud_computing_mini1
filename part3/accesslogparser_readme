access log parser reads from access log and prints the parts it should be adapted for use in the project

run this line once at start
export PATH=$PATH:~/hadoop/bin


run these lines  once for each java file 1-10 excluding 6 which doesnt exist 
javac access_log_hadoop1.java -cp $(hadoop classpath)
jar -cf access_log_hadoop1.jar access_log_hadoop1*.class
note you need to delete the output folder first if it exists
hadoop jar access_log_hadoop1.jar access_log_hadoop1 input output1

Problems 4 and 5 have helper files tht return the top 10 based on hits/accesses 
Problem 9 requires the problem 5 s helper file to find the top 3
There are 2 helper files

Get the top 10 based on value
used in problems 4 5 9
python top10.py


Get a specific keys value
used in problem 9
python keyvalue.py
